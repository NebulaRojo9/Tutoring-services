To ensure safe and sound storage of files, I have 4 kinds in saving them:
1. MathCha Website - where I mainly work on
2. Local file in my laptop - in case of no internet connection
3. GitHub - To reach files anywhere whilst syncing save from local file
4. Google Drive of my personal email - To reach files anywhere whilst syncing save from GitHub
- As much as possible, they contents of the file must be synchronous
